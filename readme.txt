Wordpress Amazon AWS Integration

This is piece of my code to integrating Amazon Web Service inside Wordpress Themes.

Usage:
1. include file theme_functions.php into your functions.php
2. paste the admin folder into your template directory

By default i only use one method to call the response from Amazon, that is get item by Keyword. There is another method that you can find at amazon_api_class.php

This project is under development, i am sorry i can't give full template. Hope you enjoy the code.
